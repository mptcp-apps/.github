# Welcome to MPTCP-Apps

Now that Multipath TCP is enabled on various Linux distributions, it's time to update the popular TCP applications so that they can use Multipath TCP instead of regular TCP. You are welcome to propose patches for popular applications so that they can be included in this project. Hopefully, within a few years most applications will use Multipath TCP by default and this project will not be required anymore.
